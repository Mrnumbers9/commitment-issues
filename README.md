#Commitment Issues

##Preface: You probably don't want to use this.
You really don't. All it does it commit to a file every 6 hours to fluff out your commit history and make you seem more productive than you actually are.

##HOW TO USE THIS

Fork, clone, and fill out the settings in `settings.py` with the URL of your `punchingbag.md` and an [OAuth token from github](https://github.com/settings/tokens). 

Then run `main.py`. If you want, you can do what I'm doing and have a cron job to run `main.py` every 6 hours.
